**Introducing New Language Support!**

We are more than pleased to announce that the Discord Resources Wiki now supports 3 new languages. Over the past few months, our volunteer translators have worked hard to make our website more accessible to people whose first language isn't english, so be sure to thank them in #Chat . Every two months we will have a polish week to update all the languages to the most updated version of the wiki.

**The following languages are now available:**
> — 🇩🇪 ` Deutsch `
> — 🇪🇸 ` Español `
> — 🇹🇷 ` Turkish `
> — 🇫🇷 ` Français `  

**(HELP WANTED) Upcoming Languages:**
Over the next month(s) we will be adding the languages listed below. We are looking for extra translators for all the below languages. Please contact @378537973215657984, if you can help. 
> — 🇵🇹 ` Portuguese (Portugal) ` 
> — 🇺🇦 ` Ukrainian ` 
> — 🇮🇳 ` Hindi ` 
> — 🇳🇱 ` Dutch ` 
> — 🇳🇴 ` Norwegian ` 
> — 🇸🇪 ` Swedish `
