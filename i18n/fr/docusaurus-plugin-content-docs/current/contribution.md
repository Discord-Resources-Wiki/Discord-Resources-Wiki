## How to test changes locally

Got a great PR going but don't know what it looks like? Not a problem!<br/>
If you're in a fork of the repository it's as easy as running these 2 commands:

```
npm install
```

This downloads all the repositories needed by our documentation system (Docusaurus). You only need to run this once.

```
npm start
```

This command starts the web server (``localhost:3000`` by default) and must be ran every time you want to start editing.
It does not need to be ran for every change you make however, as Docusaurus will automatically restart the server if it detects changes!

Once you've got a running instance of the website locally, you're ready to start contributing!
Notes: Please use ``<br/>`` for line break characters<br/>
Requires Node.js version >= ``12.13.0``
If you are using Yarn: Yarn version >= ``1.5``
